#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 



#1 How many orders were placed in January?


SELECT count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales


#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?


SELECT count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'


#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.


SELECT DISTINCT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID 
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'


#4  Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?


SELECT distinct Product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product, price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

#5  What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT sum(Quantity)*price AS Revenue, Product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY Product

#6  Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT sum(Quantity)*price AS Revenue, Product, Quantity FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product 

#7  How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(Quantity*price) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
on Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity  > 2
AND LENGTH(orderID) = 6
and orderID <> 'Order ID'

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.


SELECT Product, sum(quantity) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%' 
GROUP BY Product
